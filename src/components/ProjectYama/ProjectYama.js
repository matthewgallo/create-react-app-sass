									<h4>Challenge 1: Limited resources</h4>
									<p>
										After development discussions, it was clear that we would need many resources that were not in our budget. File storage, individual
										profiles, and commenting called for a custom database, which we could not get approval for.
									</p>
									<div className="py--challenge-1-two-by-two">
										<div className="py--challenge-1-left">
											<h5>Solution</h5>
											<p>Build the platform using GitHub API.</p>

												<li>Leverages issues as post submissions, commenting on a post/issue, image uploading.</li>

								<div className="py--challenge-1">
									<h4>Challenge 2: Tool differentiation</h4>
									<p>
										The thought of introducing another tool to the plethora of programs IBMers are using in their day-to-day was an important aspect to research
										before design/development started. I concentrated on the main tools used for sharing working, and conducted research on where we could
										create differentiation.

											<h5>Slack</h5>
											<p>
												The tool connects remote and co-located teams, and now serves as the place for communication of over 100,000 IBMers. Although easy to
												chat on, design work sharing and critiquing in virtual impossible in the fleeting nature of slack channel discussions.
											</p>
											<p className="mg--semibold">Our tool should facilitate design critique thatâ€™s focused and documented.</p>
										</div>
										<div className="py--challenge-1-right">
											<h5>Box</h5>
											<p>
												The tool is used by designers, researchers, and offering managers to sort assets, resources and deliverables. Although the tool serves
												as a great place to house your sketch files and presentation decks, its interface isnt set up for effectively viewing visual work, let
												alone contextual support.
											</p>
											<p className="mg--semibold">Our tool should focus on visual discovery at speed, without the need to house assets in all formats. </p>

												The tool is used by teams, where designers and developers work together to build production-level code. In GitHub Enterprise, teams

											<h5>Checkpoint</h5>

												The internal tool is used by designers and managers to assess product team goals and work output. The goals set in Checkpoint are
												ultimately measuring the designer&apos;s success in driving business outcomes, and can lead to career advancement. However, these goals
												are done in a text-based format, opposite of the visual outcomes designers come to.

									<h4>Challenge 3: unique habit forming value</h4>
									<p>
										After understanding how we could differentiate our tool from the others, we developed unique value propositions for the platform that would
										scope us during development, and build habit-forming experience that our designers could get behind.

									<p>
										In order to understand the best course of action for a designer moving through our platform, we developed a user flow for a &quot;Getting

										on the frames and flow.

									<p>
										Our goal for the Work Gallery experience was to create opportunities for designers coming to the platform to engage in the way they wanted
										to as quickly as possible. Those scenarios included:
									</p>
									<ul className="py--work-gallery-solution-list">
										<li>A designer looking for inspiration on a specific design element, component, or pattern they are currently working on.</li>
										<li>
											<span className="mg--semibold">Solution</span>: Increase tile size for easier investigation, more detailed hover information, and
											prominent search engine.
										</li>
										<li>A designer looking to engage in discussion by providing feedback to another designer&apos;s work</li>

											<span className="mg--semibold">Solution</span>: Card corner icon soliciting feedback, helps distinguish the projects that are actively

												My goal for the Upload Experience was to design a process that was quick enough that didn&apos;t consume too much time that interrupted

											<p>Highlights:</p>
											<p>
												<span className="mg--semibold">Collaborators</span> -- being able to tag others in an upload, showcasing the true nture of collaborative

										<div className="py--challenge-1-left">
											<h5>Portfolio Experience</h5>
											<p>
												Our goal of the Portfolio experience was to design a personal space for the designer, while creating an environment that showcases their
												work and invites others to dive deeper into their projects.
											</p>
											<p>
												Metaphorical, we wanted the Portfolio experience to feel like your bookcase at home - it had to feel like a living, constantly updated
												mess of cleanliness.
											</p>
										</div>
										<div className="py--challenge-1-right">
											<img src={portfolioLib}
												alt="Library"
												className="py--challenge-1-right-img" />
										</div>
									</div>
									<img src={profile}
										alt="Profile screenshot"
										className="py--full-image" />
									<p>
										The bookcase feels were achieved through containing the designer&apos;s work uploads and creating uniformity to each card, as if they were
										cubby shelfs that contain your work and experiences.
									</p>
									<img src={profileOverlay}
										alt="Upload screenshot"
										className="py--full-image" />
									<p>
										The card design went through multiple iterations, but we kept it high level, just enough context to know if you should dive into the
										project. We also wanted to create visual emphasis on the card your considering, but having the hover state increase the white border.
									</p>
									<img src={profileEmpty}
										alt="Empty profile screenshot"
										className="py--full-image" />
									<p>
										Lastly, we wanted to share the empty state of the workspace in the portfolio. An illustration was created that lent itself to the call to
										action to get the designer to stop what they were doing to take the time to document their process.
